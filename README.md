# yet-another-imdb-project

A small project I've done for a course in Data Science at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics. The data was retrieved from IMDb and OMDb (see `Wrangling.ipynb`). You can get the .csv [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bZeqhJixOjkc1wpm1zmz09-tyYrpTM3S?usp=sharing).

It's mostly exploratory data analysis, and some very basic topic modelling.
